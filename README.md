**More:**<br>
I work as a CMS/Front-end developer as a freelance. Made the project from layout to release. I know from the inside how companies in the financial sector work with their scoring, equifaxes, telephony, recalculations, complex business logic. I understand other people's code.
Every day I improve my programming skills. Ready to learn and experience something new. I lead a healthy lifestyle and do charity work. I love code, I’m ready to dive into some other languages and frameworks (for example NodeJS, Express, TS). I prefer WP in conjunction with Block theme - I have made a large number of commercially successful sites. 
I learning the Vue, he has a great future.
